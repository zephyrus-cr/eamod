TERMS OF AGREEMENT
===================================

By using these files you are agreeing that you are using them
at your own risk. Hybrid, Zephyrus and the eAmod are not
responsible for any code conflicts between the files here and
those in your own custom server. Although help may be given
if directly requested, these files are not supported by the
eAmod team as a whole and act only to improve, not replace,
the standard eAmod installation.

Although these files are free for use, it would be 
appreciated if they would be kept from distribution without
my permission.

If anything is bugging out, send me a shout and I'll see if
it's a problem with my code or just a conflict with yours.
The former I can fix for everyone, the latter we can discuss.
