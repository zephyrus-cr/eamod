Here you will find the popular different Ragnarok Emulators already merged with eAmod.
Made your selection about what do you want to use.

----------------------------------

- Classic : Inactive. The original and old version of eAmod. It includes some 3CeAM updates plus renewal code by me. I consider it
outdated, but some people still use it. Does not support newest clients. It support old times servers (ep 7) and Advanced
servers. About renewal, its outdated.

- eAthena : Active. The father. Bug fixes from eAmod forums and revision updates from eAthena being patched when available.

- rAthena : Active. Recommended for renewal servers. Support lastest clients. I am not always happy with updates from original
but, it works fine.

- brAthena : Active. The portuguese version of rAthena and includes some good fixes from they developers.

- 3CeAM : On merging process.

- Hercules : On merging process. [Hybrid: More news about ETA later this week] [28/04/2014]
